        Dear ________,
      </p>
      <p>
        I am writing to apply for the position as front-end developer, which you advertise on your homepage.
        Searching for Ph.D. and employment oppurtunities in England, I stumbled across your offer on indeed.co.uk.
        The language and style of the job description were most intriguing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an biotechnologist by trade and web-developer by affection, headlines like <em>100% web-based</em> and
        <em>data-management</em> instantly caught my eye on your homepage. Your approach using web technologies to
        ease and spread the use of bioinformatics strikes me as spot on and I would gladly contribute to
        this particular field.
      </p>
      <p>
        My education as biotechnologist offered me an extensive overview of biology, reaching from taxonomy over
        genetics and biochemistry to bioinformatics. Working on a student research paper I gathered first experience
        programming in R, Mathematica and the linux shell, evaluating a novel modelling technique. As a research
        assistent, I was responsible for the conceptual design of an user interface for a database system.
      </p>
      <p>
        During an internship at an market-leading bioinformatics software company I was responsible for the
        reconstruction of an genome-scale metabolic flux model. There I had the chance to improve my ability
        to work independently and demonstrate my creativity and keen perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I am working on my diploma thesis at the University of Stuttgart.
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        End positively. Say that you look forward to hearing from them and hope to discuss the role further. Also, it’s worth mentioning any dates you won’t be available for interview. If you do manage to address it to a particular person, you should sign off your letter as ‘yours sincerely’. If you’ve had to insert ‘sir/madam’ instead, you should end it with ‘yours faithfully’.
      </p>
