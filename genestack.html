        Dear Misha Kapushesky,
      </p>
      <p>
        I am writing to apply for the position as front-end developer, which you advertise on your homepage.
        Searching for Ph.D. and employment oppurtunities in England, I stumbled across your offer on indeed.co.uk.
        The language and style of the job description were most intriguing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a biotechnologist by trade and self-taught web-developer, headlines like <em>100% web-based</em> and
        <em>data-management</em> instantly caught my eye on your homepage. Your approach using web technologies to
        ease and spread the use of bioinformatics strikes me as spot on and I would gladly contribute to
        this particular field.
      </p>
      <p>
        My education as biotechnologist offered me an extensive overview of biology, reaching from taxonomy over
        genetics and biochemistry to bioinformatics. Working on a student research paper I gathered first experience
        programming in R, Mathematica and the linux shell, evaluating a novel modelling technique. As a research
        assistent, I was responsible for the conceptual design of an user interface for a database system.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a internship at an market-leading bioinformatics software company I was responsible for the
        reconstruction of an genome-scale metabolic flux model. There I had the chance to improve my ability
        to work independently and extend my knowledge towards metabolic networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I am developing a database system under the framework of a diploma thesis. This system aims to
        encompass sequence, structure and functional information and relationships for specific protein families.
        My responsibilities cover database design and maintenace as well as the development of an API for
        programmatic access and an user interface. During development I mastered HTML, CSS and SQL, and acquired
        proficiency programming functional and object-oriented PHP and JavaScript modules and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given my educational background and my autodidactic attitude, I am confident that I would make a good
        fit in the Genestack team. I am also very confident that I can pick up Java and python in no time, should
        my tasks requires it. I expect to finish my diploma thesis by the end of august at the very latest.
        I understand that you might have filled the position by then, but I would be also interested in an
        internship starting around october, should you offer any.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yours cincerely, Waldemar Reusch
      </p>
